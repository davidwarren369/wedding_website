            <span>Our Story</span>
            <p>The first time we saw each other was at rugby training, when
            the men's and women's teams joined together for the warm up
            part of the training session. It was a few months before we
            had our first conversation in 37 Dawson Street on a rugby night
            out. David knew my name when we started talking, but I didn't 
            know his until asking a friend. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We spent a number of months after that randomly liking each others 
            photo's on Instagram, before David posted a photo of Holly 
            (the family dog) in Edmundsbury, Lucan. Shauna sent David a message 
            and the conversation flowed for some time, moving over to Whatsapp 
            before David asked Shauna on their first date!
            </p>
            <p>For our first date, we went to Bunsen and onto a bar on South William
            Street, and finally moving onto Pygmalion for some more drinks where 
            the conversation flowed throughout the evening. Our second date was 
            only three days later where we took the dogs to Glendalough for a hike 
            followed by dinner in Dundrum.
            </p>
            <p>The rest they say is history...
